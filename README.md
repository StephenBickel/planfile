**Terraform for AI agent side effects.**

Your AI agent wants to edit 14 files and run 3 shell commands. Do you trust it?

`gatefile` makes agent side effects explicit, reviewable, and approvable — before anything executes.

```bash
npx gatefile inspect-plan .plan/plan.json    # see exactly what the agent wants to do
npx gatefile approve-plan .plan/plan.json    # approve the hash-locked plan
npx gatefile apply-plan .plan/plan.json      # execute with safety guardrails
```

## Why

Agent tooling is good at *doing* things but weak at *governing* side effects.

- Hidden file edits buried in PR-sized bursts
- Shell commands with unclear blast radius
- No durable artifact for review, approval, or audit
- Tests verify behavior *after* changes. Traces show what happened *during*. Neither gives you a machine-readable **intent contract** *before* execution

Today, teams rely on prompts and trust. That doesn't scale.

## How It Works

```
Agent emits plan → Human reviews → Approve hash → Apply with guardrails
```

1. **Create** — agent declares intended file changes + commands as a JSON plan
2. **Inspect** — human or CI reviews the plan (concise summary or `--json` for machines)
3. **Verify** — integrity check confirms the plan hasn't been tampered with
4. **Approve** — human or policy engine approves, binding to the exact plan hash
5. **Apply** — execute with precondition checks, path sandboxing, command policies, and timeouts

Approval is hash-bound: if anyone modifies the plan after approval, `verify` catches it and `apply` refuses.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install gatefile

# Or run directly
npx gatefile --help
```

### End-to-End Demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StephenBickel/gatefile.git
cd gatefile
npm install
npm run demo:e2e
```

This runs the full flow: create → inspect → verify → approve → dry-run → denied unsafe path → safe apply → PR gate adoption.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Agent creates a plan
gatefile create-plan --from examples/coding-agent-plan.json --out .plan/plan.json

# Review what it wants to do
gatefile inspect-plan .plan/plan.json

# Machine-readable for CI
gatefile inspect-plan .plan/plan.json --json

# Check integrity
gatefile verify-plan .plan/plan.json

# Preview without executing
gatefile apply-plan .plan/plan.json --dry-run

# Approve (binds to exact hash)
gatefile approve-plan .plan/plan.json --by steve

# Execute
gatefile apply-plan .plan/plan.json --yes
```

### Agent Adapter (MVP)

Use `adapt-agent` when an external agent emits concise proposal-style JSON:

```bash
gatefile adapt-agent --from examples/agent-adapter-input.json --out .plan/adapter-draft.json
gatefile create-plan --from .plan/adapter-draft.json --out .plan/plan.json
gatefile inspect-plan .plan/plan.json
```

See [docs/agent-adapter.md](docs/agent-adapter.md) for supported input formats and full workflow details.

## Safety Guardrails

`apply-plan` enforces multiple safety layers:

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Hash binding** | Approval locks to exact plan content — tampering detected |
| **File sandboxing** | Writes restricted to workspace root (configurable via `filePolicy.allowedRoots`) |
| **Command policy** | Allow/deny patterns for shell commands |
| **Timeouts** | Default 10s per command, configurable per-operation or plan-wide |
| **Preconditions** | Guard checks (branch, clean tree, env vars) must pass before apply |
| **Dry-run** | Preview everything without executing — works before or after approval |
| **Recovery hints** | Apply reports include affected paths and manual rollback guidance |

## GitHub PR Gate

Drop a gatefile check into any CI pipeline:

```yaml
- uses: StephenBickel/gatefile/.github/actions/gatefile-pr-gate@main
  with:
    plan-path: .plan/plan.json
```

See [docs/github-pr-gate-example.md](docs/github-pr-gate-example.md) for full workflow examples.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Plan** | Immutable JSON artifact describing proposed side effects |
| **Changeset** | File diffs (`create`, `update`, `delete`) and command intents |
| **Risk Profile** | Heuristic score + rationale per operation |
| **Preconditions** | Guards that must pass before apply |
| **Approval** | Hash-bound human or policy gate |
| **Apply Report** | What executed, what failed, and why |

## Roadmap

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for near-term plans. Current focus:

- [x] CLI with create/inspect/verify/approve/apply
- [x] Hash-bound approval with tamper detection
- [x] Command + file path safety policies
- [x] Dry-run preview mode
- [x] GitHub PR gate action
- [x] Recovery guidance in apply reports
- [x] Agent adapter command (`adapt-agent`) for proposal-to-draft conversion
- [ ] Policy hook interfaces (`beforeApprove`, `beforeApply`)
- [ ] Signing/attestation workflows
- [ ] Agent SDK integrations
