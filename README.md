**Terraform for AI agent side effects.**

![gatefile demo](demo.gif)

Your AI agent wants to edit 14 files and run 3 shell commands. Do you trust it?

`gatefile` makes agent side effects explicit, reviewable, and approvable — before anything executes.

```bash
npx gatefile review .plan/plan.json          # interactive TUI: inspect, approve, or reject
npx gatefile inspect-plan .plan/plan.json    # see exactly what the agent wants to do
npx gatefile approve-plan .plan/plan.json    # approve the hash-locked plan
npx gatefile apply-plan .plan/plan.json      # execute with safety guardrails
```

## Why

Agent tooling is good at *doing* things but weak at *governing* side effects.

- Hidden file edits buried in PR-sized bursts
- Shell commands with unclear blast radius
- No durable artifact for review, approval, or audit
- Tests verify behavior *after* changes. Traces show what happened *during*. Neither gives you a machine-readable **intent contract** *before* execution

Today, teams rely on prompts and trust. That doesn't scale.

## How It Works

```
Agent emits plan → Human reviews → Approve hash → Apply with guardrails → Rollback if needed
```

## Who Is This For?

**Engineering teams shipping autonomous agents to production.** Your agent proposes a database migration, a config rewrite, and a deploy script. Today you either babysit every action or trust full-auto. Gatefile is the middle ground: agent-speed planning with human-gated execution.

**DevOps teams building AI-powered CI/CD.** When an agent is part of your pipeline — auto-fix, auto-refactor, auto-migrate — you need a machine-readable checkpoint between "agent proposed this" and "this actually ran." Gatefile is that checkpoint, with a GitHub Action ready to drop into any workflow.

**Regulated industries.** Finance, healthcare, government — anywhere an auditor asks "who authorized this change?" Gatefile's signed attestations give you cryptographic proof of who approved what, when, bound to the exact plan hash.

**Not for you if:** you're a solo developer comfortable with Claude Code or Codex full-auto on low-stakes code. If the blast radius is small and reversible, you don't need governance — just `git revert`.

## How Is This Different?

| | Claude Code / Codex | Git + PR Review | Gatefile |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Interactive session approval | Code diffs only | File edits + shell commands + preconditions |
| **Durability** | Disappears with the session | Commit history | Persistent plan artifact on disk |
| **Tamper detection** | None | Git hash (post-merge) | Hash-locked before execution |
| **Identity proof** | None | GitHub commit signing | Ed25519 signed attestation |
| **Audit trail** | Terminal scrollback | PR comments | Structured receipts + snapshots |
| **CI integration** | Manual | Native | Native (GitHub Action included) |
| **Agent-agnostic** | Tied to one agent | N/A | Any agent, any framework |

Claude Code asks "can I run this?" and you click yes. Gatefile makes the "yes" a durable, tamper-evident, auditable artifact.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install gatefile
```

### See It Work (30 seconds)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StephenBickel/gatefile.git
cd gatefile && npm install
npm run demo:e2e
```

The demo runs the full flow: create → inspect → verify → approve → dry-run → denied unsafe path → safe apply → PR gate.

### Basic Flow

```bash
# 1. Agent creates a plan declaring its intended side effects
gatefile create-plan --from examples/coding-agent-plan.json --out .plan/plan.json

# Interactive review (TUI with diff preview, approve/reject)
gatefile review .plan/plan.json

# Non-interactive inspection
gatefile inspect-plan .plan/plan.json

# 3. Machine-readable for CI
gatefile inspect-plan .plan/plan.json --json

# 4. Check integrity
gatefile verify-plan .plan/plan.json

# 5. Preview without executing
gatefile apply-plan .plan/plan.json --dry-run

# 6. Approve — binds to exact plan hash
gatefile approve-plan .plan/plan.json --by steve

# 7. Execute with guardrails
gatefile apply-plan .plan/plan.json --yes

# 8. Roll back file operations if needed
gatefile rollback-apply <receipt-id> --yes
```

### With Signed Approvals

For environments that need cryptographic proof of who approved:

```bash
# Generate a signing key
gatefile generate-attestation-key --out-private .gatefile/approval-key.pem --out-public .gatefile/approval-key.pub.pem

# Approve with signature
gatefile approve-plan .plan/plan.json --by steve --signing-key .gatefile/approval-key.pem

# Validate config + trust policy
gatefile lint-config
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Coding Agent in a Monorepo

An agent proposes a refactor touching 30 files across 4 packages. Without Gatefile, you either read every diff interactively or trust full-auto. With Gatefile, the agent emits a plan, your tech lead reviews the operation summary and risk scores, approves the hash, and apply executes only what was approved.

### 2. Production Ops Automation

An ops agent wants to rotate configs, restart a service, and validate health. The plan declares the exact file changes, commands, and preconditions (must be on `main`, must have `ALLOW_OPS_APPLY` set). Apply refuses if preconditions fail, and every action is receipted for rollback.

### 3. CI Gate for Agent PRs

An agent opens PRs autonomously. Your CI pipeline runs `gatefile verify-plan` as a required status check. No approved plan, no merge. The PR includes machine-readable intent so reviewers see exactly what will happen — not just what code changed.

### 4. Compliance Audit Trail

Post-incident, the security team needs to prove what was authorized. Gatefile's plan + signed approval + apply receipt + pre-apply snapshot chain gives them a complete, cryptographically verifiable record from intent to execution.

### Agent Adapter

When an external agent emits proposal-style JSON instead of Gatefile's native format:

```bash
gatefile adapt-agent --from examples/agent-adapter-input.json --out .plan/adapter-draft.json
gatefile create-plan --from .plan/adapter-draft.json --out .plan/plan.json
```

See [docs/agent-adapter.md](docs/agent-adapter.md) for supported input formats.

## Safety Guardrails

`apply-plan` enforces multiple safety layers:

| Layer | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Hash binding** | Approval locks to exact plan content — any tampering blocks execution |
| **Signer trust policy** | Trusted signer allowlist via `gatefile.config.json` |
| **File sandboxing** | Writes restricted to workspace root (configurable via `filePolicy.allowedRoots`) |
| **Command policy** | Allow/deny patterns for shell commands |
| **Timeouts** | Default 10s per command, configurable per-operation or plan-wide |
| **Preconditions** | Guard checks (branch, clean tree, env vars) must pass before apply |
| **Policy hooks** | Optional `beforeApprove`/`beforeApply` hooks |
| **Dependencies** | `dependsOn` requires prior successful apply receipts |
| **Dry-run** | Preview everything without executing — works before or after approval |
| **Snapshots + receipts** | Pre-apply file snapshots and structured apply receipts |
| **Rollback** | `rollback-apply` restores files from snapshot (commands are not auto-reverted) |

## MCP Server

gatefile ships an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server so any MCP-compatible host (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) can inspect, verify, approve, and apply plans directly.

### Configure in Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gatefile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["gatefile-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tools Exposed

| Tool | Description |
|------|------------|
| `gatefile_inspect` | Inspect a plan — returns operations, risk level, integrity, and approval state |
| `gatefile_verify` | Verify plan integrity — hash match, approval binding, ready/not-ready status |
| `gatefile_approve` | Approve a plan — binds approval to the exact plan hash |
| `gatefile_apply` | Apply a plan with safety guardrails (defaults to dry-run mode) |

The `gatefile_apply` tool defaults to `dryRun: true` for safety. Set `dryRun: false` to execute real changes.

## Programmatic API

Use gatefile as a library in your own tools:

```typescript
import { createPlan, inspectPlan, approvePlanFile, verifyPlanFile, applyPlanFile } from "gatefile";

// Create a plan from a draft
const plan = await createPlan(draft, { outPath: ".plan/plan.json" });

// Inspect, approve, verify, apply
const report = await inspectPlan(".plan/plan.json");
await approvePlanFile(".plan/plan.json", { approvedBy: "ci-bot" });
const status = await verifyPlanFile(".plan/plan.json");
const result = await applyPlanFile(".plan/plan.json");          // real apply
const preview = await applyPlanFile(".plan/plan.json", { dryRun: true }); // dry-run
```

The low-level in-memory functions (`createPlanFromDraft`, `approvePlan`, `verifyPlan`, `applyPlan`, `previewPlan`) are also exported for advanced use cases.

## GitHub PR Gate

Drop a gatefile check into any CI pipeline:

```yaml
- uses: StephenBickel/gatefile/.github/actions/gatefile-pr-gate@main
  with:
    plan-path: .plan/plan.json
```

See [docs/github-pr-gate-example.md](docs/github-pr-gate-example.md) for full workflow examples, including [CI-native signed approvals](docs/examples/github-native-signed-approval.yml) and [fork-safe signing](docs/examples/github-native-signed-approval-fork-request.yml).

## Config + Hooks

Use `gatefile.config.json` to enforce policy hooks and signer trust:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "beforeApprove": { "command": "node ./scripts/before-approve.js" },
    "beforeApply": { "command": "node ./scripts/before-apply.js" }
  },
  "signers": {
    "trustedKeyIds": ["security-team-prod-1"],
    "trustedPublicKeys": ["-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"]
  }
}
```

Hooks receive structured JSON on stdin and env vars (`GATEFILE_HOOK_EVENT`, `GATEFILE_PLAN_ID`, `GATEFILE_PLAN_HASH`, `GATEFILE_REPO_ROOT`). Non-zero exit blocks the action. Validate anytime with `gatefile lint-config`.

## Hooks

gatefile can fire webhooks and shell commands on lifecycle events. Add a `gatefile.config.json` to your project root:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "onPlanCreated": {
      "webhook": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T.../B.../xxx",
      "shell": "echo plan ready"
    },
    "onApprovalNeeded": {
      "webhook": "https://example.com/approval-webhook",
      "shell": "notify-send 'approval needed'"
    }
  }
}
```

| Event | Fires when | Payload |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `onPlanCreated` | After `create-plan` completes | Plan summary JSON |
| `onApprovalNeeded` | After `approve-plan` completes | Plan summary JSON (with approval) |

Both `webhook` and `shell` are optional — use one or both. Webhook sends a `POST` with `Content-Type: application/json`. Errors in hooks warn to stderr but never fail the main operation.

See [schema/gatefile.config.schema.json](schema/gatefile.config.schema.json) for the full config schema.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Plan** | Immutable JSON artifact describing proposed side effects |
| **Changeset** | File diffs (`create`, `update`, `delete`) and command intents |
| **Risk Profile** | Heuristic score + rationale per operation |
| **Preconditions** | Guards that must pass before apply |
| **Approval** | Hash-bound human or policy gate |
| **Attestation** | Optional Ed25519 signature proving approval identity |
| **Apply Receipt** | Structured record of what executed, for rollback and audit |
